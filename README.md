# Internet

## [How does the internet work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42aWAAqoUfI) 🌐

> The internet its a "wire" (infraestructure) that interconects the people (clients) arround the world. The client connects to that infraestructure and other system serves with information (For example, a web page), that system is called server. Its good to say, that the internet, es free and open. 

## [What is HTTP?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/)

> Its a protocol for transfering information between network devices.  It defines how text, images and video (information) are transmitted on the web.

* [HTTP Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
    * Indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from the queried server. For example, two of the most common HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; 
* [HTTP status code](https://httpstatuses.com/)
    * Is a 3-digit code most often used to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. 

## [Browsers and how they work?](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/what-is-a-browser/)

> A web browser it's a software that'll retrieve information (The comunication it's handled with HTTP!) from the web and display it to you in a nice way to understand.

* Cookies 🍪
    * A website may need to store some data, and that data will be stored on a file, that file is called "a cookie". Those files are stored locally on you system, and when you access again to that web page, it'll read the file and retrieve that information, it maybe be some credentials, or preferences taht you set on the page.

## [DNS and how it works?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) 📖

> For good understanding, let's call it like cloudflare does, "the phone book of internet"

* How it works?
    * It's simple. First you go to a web like google.com (A hostname), and you setted dns server will translate the hostname to the IP, that at the time of writing, it's "172.69.68.203" for that hostname. Tha IP locates the google server, it's like a street address is used to find a particular home.

* Why DNS exist?
    * Because nobody will want to remember "172.69.68.203" as an address to a website, right?. So you put the address that everyone knows, like "google.com" and then the DNS server translate it for you.

_There is a lot more involved in DNS servers, check the link at the title for more information._

## What is Domain Name? 🏡

> Is the address where Internet users can access your website (Like in the past example, google.com) and they were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

## [What is hosting?](https://www.website.com/beginnerguide/webhosting/6/1/what-is-web-hosting?.ws) 🖥️

>  Is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A good and modern example for web hosting, is [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Basic front-end knowledge

## HTML

> HTML **is not a programming language**. It's a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
